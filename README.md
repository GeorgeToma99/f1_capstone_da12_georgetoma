# Alex Albon vs. Sergio "Checo" Perez: Red Bull Racing Performance Comparison

## Introduction

Welcome to the Alex Albon vs. Sergio "Checo" Perez: Red Bull Racing Performance Comparison project! This analysis aims to compare the performances of Alex Albon and Sergio Perez during their time at Red Bull Racing, focusing on their ability to compete against Max Verstappen. By examining their progression over seasons, adaptability across teams, and lap times, we explore whether Red Bull made the right decision in replacing Albon with Perez.

## Technologies

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Tableau (for interactive visualizations)

## Features

- Data cleaning and exploration scripts
- Visualizations comparing driver progression, race results, and lap times
- Analysis of each driver’s adaptability across teams (Red Bull, Williams, Racing Point)
- In-depth performance comparison against Max Verstappen

## Scope

- Explored driver progression across seasons, comparing Sergio Perez, Alex Albon, and Max Verstappen.
- Analyzed the adaptability of each driver at different teams: Albon at Williams, Perez at Racing Point, and Gasly at Toro Rosso.
- Examined team progression at Red Bull Racing and Williams.
- Compared lap times between each driver and Max Verstappen across various seasons and race conditions.

## Project Status

- Completed

## Conclusion

- Sergio Perez proved to be the better choice for Red Bull due to his consistency and experience, qualities that Alex Albon lacked. While Albon showed potential, his performance was inconsistent, especially compared to Max Verstappen. Perez’s reliability and ability to adapt to Red Bull’s needs made him a stronger option for the team’s success.
